# Explain User and Software Requirements


software requirements are given to you by the client. When you first meet them they give you information on what they want in thier product. They will give you a brief of the project. After that you must create Epics which you will be central when designing and programming. You will also break down User Stories into smaller stories to follow while you work, and help for debugging.

Epic Stories is a large body of work that are normally addressed as milestones for most programmers. Which they may meet over time by completing smaller tasks.

User Stories are a smaller amount of work than an Epic Story these User Stories can also be known as tasks which can be completed within a day or two. There is normally a certain number of User Stories in side of an Epic Story
