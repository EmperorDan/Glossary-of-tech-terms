# Explain how user and software Requirements
software requirements were given to us by our client ZSL. When we first met with ZSL they gave us information on what they wanted in thier product. They gave us a brief for the project. After reading through it we created Epics which were the central focus while developing our application. We then took our Epics and broke them down into User Stories. To create the user stories we had to keep the epic in mind and break it down into smaller stories such as "as a user i want to learn about the four habitats".

- Epics are what are user wants ultimately. While working with ZSL we were told to make an application to educate children of their carbon footprint. So one epic would be "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" The stories are coming from the perspective of the child user and what they want. Epic Stories are normally addressed as milestones for most programmers. 

- User stories are what the user wants. User stories are what contribute to making an epic. You take your epic and break it down into various user stories relating to your application. From "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" you could take for example "As a user i want to see the impact on the enviroment". Another one could be "As a user i want to be able to select from four different habitats".

- Meetings will be scheduled regularly with ZSL to check up on progress. This is so that we know we are on track, and to allow us time to rectify mistakes we have made. During these interviews we have the opportunity to ask any relevant questions, take notes, and gather feedback from are client.

- Purpose, the purpose of a given project is the epic that was provided. For ZSL this is the epic we used "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment". The epic is the projects ultimate desired outcome. Once you have your epic you must break it down into user stories.

- An overview was written for our project with ZSL once it was finalised. This will give a summary of what our projects subject is and an explanation of the game as a whole.
