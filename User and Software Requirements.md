# Explain how user and software Requirements
software requirements are given to you by the client. When you first meet them they give you information on what they want in thier product. They will give you a brief of the project. After that you must create Epics which you will be central when designing, and programming. You will also break down User Stories into smaller stories to follow while you work, and this will help for debugging. 

- Epics are what are user wants ultimately. While working with ZSL we were told to make an application to educate children of their carbon footprint. So one epic would be "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" The stories are coming from the perspective of the child user and what they want. Epic Stories are normally addressed as milestones for most programmers. 

- User stories are what the user wants. User stories are what contribute to making an epic. You take your epic and break it down into various user stories relating to your application. From "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" you could take for example "As a user i want to see the impact on the enviroment". Another one could be "As a user i want to be able to select from four different habitats".

- Meetings will be scheduled regularly to check up on progress. This is so that we know we are on track, and to allow us time to rectify mistakes we have made.

- Purpose, the purpose of a given project is the epic that was provided. It is the projects desired outcome. This is done before starting on user stories.

- An overview is written once the project is finalised. This will give a summary of what the game is and how it works.
