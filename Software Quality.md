# Software Quality

## Scheduled Testing
Testing is a necessity when programming, as you encounters bugs, and other issues reguarly. Without regular scheduled testing, you run the risk of issues becoming practically unfixable, later in development. A subjective, and reliable way of testing your software would be the use of testers. The most benefitial time being at the start of your project as most issues with software stem from the early stages. Getting this testing in early will allow you the time you need to rectify the issues.

## Improving testing
Testing is extremely important, because of this you will need to establish what testing process your going to use. This is important when training testers because it brings consistency to their work. Focusing on one process for training will allow your testers to grow more confident, and productive. With the testers not having to focus on multiple processes, they can focus more on the testing itself.   

## Keep your mind open
Industry is constantly changing in unpredictable ways. To stay relevant, it is essential to accept new pratices, frameworks, ect. It's also important to use facilities that make development more convenient. Companies can use automated testing, which is when a testing program is used to detect bugs. The benefit of this is that the program can run tests repetitively, with accuracy, and can be done in hours. Manual tests cost more and can take days. 

## Reviewing
Root cause analysis is the process of discovering where issues originated. This is a constructive process, the benefit being you learn from your mistakes. Reviewing your work and understanding where you have gone right/wrong is important. 'keeping your mind open' is your biggest advantage, and you need to be able to critically evaluate your own work.
