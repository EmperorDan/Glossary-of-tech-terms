# Procedural programming
## Definition
Procedral programming is when you give a computer direct instruction to carry out a task. The instructions follow logical steps to achieve the given task. 
## Characteristics
- Procedral programming is condensed making it easier for newcomers.
- Procedral programming is usually faster than alternatives. This is because your aware of the most logical way a computer can complete your given task. Because the computer does it in the most logical way it saves on performance.
# Object orientated programming (OOP)
## Definition
Object orientated programming uses 'objects'. These 'objects' are given characteristics, and behaviours. This allows them to be grouped together because of the diversity between them. Because they are easily distinguishable it allows the developer to focus on the relationships between the 'objects'. 
## Characteristics
- Once the 'objects' have been created, they can be worked on indepently. This is a appealing to large projects where communication is nescessary but not always possible.
- You can recycle 'objects' from one project and, if your able, incorporate them into another.
# Event driven programming
## Definition
Event driven programming is centered around user events, and input. User events are actions like mouse clicks, or typing. So a program built with this paradigm is heavily reliant on user interaction.  
## Characteristics
- Most languages can be used for event driven programming, making it a flexible paradigm.
- Most modern GUI programs are using event driven programming.
- Is compatible with a mix of hardware and sensors.
