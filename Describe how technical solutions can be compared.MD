# Describe how technical solutions can be compared
Below are some of the factors that a developer will look at when comparing technical solution:

Fitness: You want to address the problems your facing. You must consider whether or not the technology will fix the problem, or whether its nessecessy. Another issue may be that it breaks functional aspects of your application which could be detrimental to your progress.

Maturity: It is important that your confident your product is ready for realease. It can be a massive setback releasing an imcomplete product as that is effectively your first impression en-masse depending on the scale of the project.

Support: During, and after creating a product it is important to have support set up. If any problems occur within your application having support in place will give users the ability to report problems as they arise. This is free, mostly unbiased, feedback which is invaluable. 

License and support costs: You must consider costs for software. Annual subscription can be extortionate so its important to find the most cost effective software for your company to use. You want to save money here anything unessecary will impact your profits. You must also consider what your collegues are familiar/comfortable with using. It can be damaging to a team if people within are unfamiliar with a particular software so its important to choose wisely.

After ZSL had given us a description of what they wanted, it was time to make our epic. We reviewed the documentation on the subject and read are notes for our meeting with Michelle on 02/10/17. Michelle made it clear that the greenhouse chain was the focus for this project. The greenhouse chain involves lights not being switched off, the production of Phones, and things involved were directly linked with social norms. So we decided the focus was the effect an individual has on their environment. So the epic we came too use was "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" we thought this summed up the ultimate message of the project.
