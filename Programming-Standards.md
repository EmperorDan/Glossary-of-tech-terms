# Programming Terms

- When writing code I first look at what is required and break it down into smaller peices. After this I create a flowchart that will map the processes i think the computer will go through. The next step is translating this to a programming language.

- Interpreter: An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

- Procedural: Procedral programming relies on procedures. A procedure contains a series of computational steps to be carried out.

- Event driven: 'Event driven' is a programming paradigm where control flow is determined by the occurrence of events.

- Oject oriented: In programmming 'object orientated' means that it works using objects,as opposed to actions and data rather than logic.

- Compiler: Compiler describes computer software that is used to translate code from one language to another.

- Algorythm: An algorithm is an unambiguous (not open to more than one interpretation) specification of how to solve a class of problems.
