# CMM

## Levels of Maturity:

### Maturity level 1:
- Maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and services that work but company has no standard process for software development. Nor does it have a project-tracking system that enables developers to predict costs or finish dates with any accuracy.
- Maturity level 1 organizations are characterized by a tendency to over commit, abandon processes in the time of crisis, and not be able to repeat their past successes.

### Maturity level 2: 
- The process discipline reflected by maturity level 2 helps to ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress. When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans.
- At maturity level 2, requirements, processes, work products, and services are managed. The status of the work products and the delivery of services are visible to management at defined points.
- Commitments are established among relevant stakeholders and are revised as needed. Work products are reviewed with stakeholders and are controlled.
- The work products and services satisfy their specified requirements, standards, and objectives.

### Maturity level 3:
- A critical distinction between maturity level 2 and maturity level 3 is the scope of standards, process descriptions, and procedures. 
- At maturity level 3, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes to suit a particular project or organizational unit.
- The organization’s set of standard processes includes the processes addressed at maturity level 2 and maturity level 3. As a result, the processes that are performed across the organization are consistent except for the differences allowed by the tailoring guidelines.
- Another critical distinction is that at maturity level 3, processes are typically described in more detail and more rigorously than at maturity level 2.
- At maturity level 3, processes are managed more proactively using an understanding of the interrelationships of the process activities and detailed measures of the process, its work products, and its services.

### Maturity level 4:
- Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and used as criteria in managing processes. Quantitative objectives are based on the needs of the customer, end users, organization, and process implementers. 
  - Quality and process performance are understood in statistical terms and are managed throughout the life of the processes.
  - For these processes, detailed measures of process performance are collected and statistically analyzed. Special causes of process variation are identified and, where appropriate, the sources of special causes are corrected to prevent future occurrences.
- Quality and process performance measures are incorporated into the organizations measurement repository to support fact-based decision making in the future.
- A critical distinction between maturity level 3 and maturity level 4 is the predictability of process performance. At maturity level 4, the performance of processes is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques, and is quantitatively predictable. At maturity level 3, processes are only qualitatively predictable.

### Maturity level 5:
- Maturity level 5 focuses on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements.
- Quantitative process-improvement objectives for the organization are established, continually revised to reflect changing business objectives, and used as criteria in managing process improvement.
- The effects of deployed process improvements are measured and evaluated against the quantitative process-improvement objectives. Both the defined processes and the organization’s set of standard processes are targets of measurable improvement activities.
- The organization’s ability to rapidly respond to changes and opportunities is enhanced by finding ways to accelerate and share learning. Improvement of the processes is inherently part of everybody’s role, resulting in a cycle of continual improvement.
