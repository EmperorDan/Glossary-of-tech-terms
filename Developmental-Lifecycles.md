# Lifecycles

## Introduction
advantages
disadvantages 
examples of software that could benefit from each specific lifecycle.

## Waterfall
### Description:
The waterfall model is a linear sequential flow.  This means software inplementation follows a downward path. The path usually consists of, in order: Requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, operation. The idea of this cycle is that no process is begun, until the previous has been finished. 
### Advantages:
- Very simple to understand, and use.
- Easily managed due to it following a fixed path.
- This is benefitial to smaller projects.
### Disadvantages:
- Is very difficult to change things that were wrong in the concept stage.
- Can be very risky, as working software only comes towards the end.
- Not a good choice for long/ongoing projects.
### Software That can benefit:
Any software that has a clear undestanding of what their end goal is. The reason being that their arent opportunities to go back and change things.

## Evolutionary
### Description:
The Evolutionary model is iterative. The model allows the user to create increasingly complete version's of their software. This process involves creating a product rapidly. The product is then changed based on maintenance, and reviewal.
### Advantages:
- Product better fits customer needs.
- Allows constant inprovement.
- Can analyse each phase for issues.
- Lowers risk of serious defects during testing.
### Disadvantages:
- Development can slow as the number of end users increases.
- Over long periods, could cause loss in consumer interest.
- The number of changes can cause serious problems.
### Software That can benefit:
Indie Videogame developers can benefit the most from this model. Alot of indie games start distributing in the alpha stage. They then gather feedback from thier users and patch as they go. This is definitely useful for creating a personalised experience for users.

## Prototyping
### Description:
The Protyping model is used to create a system with overall functionality. 
### Advantages:
- You work out, what the user wants out of your product. This will reduce costs from changes later on, which are, by far, the most expensive. These things are possible because you have defined your project early. 
- similiar to the evolutionary model. Prototyping produces a working product quickly. This means that there is alot of user involvement. 
### Disadvantages:
- If you spend an excessive amount of time producing your protype.
- Insuffient analysis,due to the time frame, can lead to major issues with your prototype.
- Expensive to start a prototype due to the speed of the process.
### Software That can benefit:
- Can benefit developers who have a clear idea of what they want in the end.
- Online systems, and web interfaces, would benefit. Because they have a high amount of end users.

## Spiral
### Description:
The spiral model is like the incremental model, but with more dedicated to risk analysis. The model follows four phases: Risk analysis, Engineering and evaluation. The project will go through these phases repeaetably in iterations (called spirals in this model). Every spiral builds off the base spiral.
### Advantages:
- Less risk due to high amount of risk analysis.
- Additional Functionality can be added at a later date.
- Software is produced early in the software life cycle.
- Good for large projects.
### Disadvantages:
- Can be costly to use.
- Doesn't work with smaller projects.
- Requires highly specific expertise is risk analysis.
### Software That can benefit:
- A new product line, when costs and risk evaluation is essential. 
- Usually required, when the user is unsure of what they want.

## Rapid Application Development (RAD)
### Description:
The RAD model is a type of incremental model. The components of this model are split into mini projects. The aim of this model is to assemble a working prototype quickly. This gives the user something to see, and provide feedback on.
### Advantages:
- Reduces development time.
- Uses customer feedback to improve.
- Increased reusability of components.
### Disadvantages:
- Requires highly skilled developers/designers.
- This model is expensive to use.
- Needs a strong team.
### Software That can benefit:
- Is useful when creating a system, that can be modularized, in a short space of time.

## Traditional/Agile
### Description:
#### Agile:
Agile methodologies, such as the evolutionary model, are more flexible. The aim is to build a functional program quickly. Agile models allow you to go back to previous stages, and change things when necessary. 
#### Traditional:
An example of a traditional method is the waterfall model. Traditional methodologies path follows a linear sequential. This makes it difficult to go back and change implementations made in the early stages. 

### Comparison:
- Traditional methodolgies are fixed, and well realised at conception. Whereas agile methodologies are more flexible, allowing more change. 
### Advantages:
#### Agile:
- Flexibility: Ability to go back and change things realised in the conceptional phase.
- A working product is created quickly. This methodology uses customer feedback to create a better product.
#### Traditional:
- Projects using a traditional approach, are usually completed withing budget.
- Syuitable for mass production. 
### Disadvantages:
#### Agile:
- In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.
- There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.
- The project can easily get taken off track if the customer is not clear what final outcome that they want.
#### Traditional:
- lack of customer attention, meaning customer needs not being met.
- Traditional projects require very large lead time so it has a tendency to fall behind the timetable.
### Software That can benefit:
#### Agile:
- Agile methodologies are benefitial to videogames, especially ones rely on user feedback. 
- Commercial applications, such as shopping apps, use this methodology. They use it to go back and change aspects of there app, based on user feedback.  
#### Traditional:
- Traditional methodologies are best suited for engineering-based projects. 
- They require extensive planning before hand. They must only be used when the final program is well realised at conception.

## Formal
### Description:
Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.
### Advantages:
- Discovers ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency in the software.
- Incrementally grows in effective solution after each iteration.
- This model does not involve high complexity rate.
- Formal specification language semantics verify self-consistency.
### Disadvantages:
- Time consuming and expensive.
- Extensive training is required to have the essential knowledge to implement this model.
### Software That can benefit:
- Mistakes in computer systems can have dire consequences: large monetary damage can occur, or human lives can be endangered. In these cases, the traditional error prevention methods are often insufficient. However, employing formal methods can help to achieve the desired safety level.
- Formal methods in software engineering are mathematical techniques that are used in the design, implementation and testing of computer systems.
