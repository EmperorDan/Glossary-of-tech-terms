# Lifecycles

## Introduction
advantages
disadvantages 
examples of software that could benefit from each specific lifecycle.

## Waterfall (Sequential)
### Description:
The waterfall model is a linear sequential flow.  This means software inplementation follows a downward path. The path usually consists of, in order: Requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, operation. The idea of this cycle is that no process is begun, until the previous has been finished. 
### Advantages:
- Very simple to understand, and use.
- Easily managed due to it following a fixed path.
- This is benefitial to smaller projects.
### Disadvantages:
- Is very difficult to change things that were wrong in the concept stage.
- Can be very risky, as working software only comes towards the end.
- Not a good choice for long/ongoing projects.
### Software That can benefit:
Any software that has a clear undestanding of what their end goal is. The reason being that their arent opportunities to go back and change things.

## V Model (Sequential)
### Description
A V-model is where the execution of processes fall sequentially. It flows sequentially like the waterfall model. Where it differs is the there are three paths. The reason being because testing is done in parallel, so you cannot move onto the next phase before completing the last one.    
### Advantages
- This is a highly disciplined model due to each phase being completed sequentially. This means alot of testing is involved and if it's completed correctly is more robust.
- This is benefitial to a smaller project, due to the fact you cant go back and edit once you move onto the next phase.
- Easily managed because you have a clear path to follow.
### Disadvantages
- Can be very risky because you cannot re-visit phases that have been completed.
  - Unusuable for larger/ongoing project as you aren't able to re-visit previous phases.
- Not to be used if your product is at risk of changing during development.
- No working software is produced till the final stages which is a monumental risk.
### Software that can benefit
Developers who have a clear idea of what they want early on will benefit from this. This is because it's not a very flexible model making changes later on to earlier phases impossible. This can be damaging to the product, and developer. If the work done in the early phases isn't correct then the project is vulnerable to failure.

## Evolutionary (Iterative)
### Description:
The Evolutionary model is iterative. The model allows the user to create increasingly complete version's of their software. This process involves creating a product rapidly. You must have the requirements and architecture in place. This is so you can produce a functional product for your users. A product undergoes changes periodically based on maintenance checks finding issues, reviewal of product, and feedback from users. 
### Advantages:
- Product better fits customer needs.
- Allows constant inprovement.
- Can analyse each phase for issues.
- Lowers risk of serious defects during testing.
### Disadvantages:
- Development can slow as the number of end users increases.
- Over long periods, could cause loss in consumer interest.
- The number of changes can cause serious problems.
### Software That can benefit:
Indie Videogame developers can benefit the most from this model. Alot of indie games start distributing in the alpha stage. They then gather feedback from thier users and patch as they go. This is definitely useful for creating a personalised experience for users.

## Spiral (Iterative)
### Description:
The spiral model is more dedicated to risk analysis than others of its type. The model follows four phases: Risk analysis, Engineering and evaluation. The project will go through these phases repeatably in iterations (called spirals in this model). Every spiral builds off the base spiral.
### Advantages:
- Less risk due to high amount of risk analysis.
- Additional Functionality can be added at a later date.
- Software is produced early in the software life cycle.
- Good for large projects.
### Disadvantages:
- Can be costly to use.
- Doesn't work with smaller projects.
- Requires highly specific expertise is risk analysis.
### Software That can benefit:
- A new product line, when costs and risk evaluation is essential. 
- Usually required, when the user is unsure of what they want.
