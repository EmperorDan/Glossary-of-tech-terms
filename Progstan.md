# Programming Standards

### 1. When writing code I first look at what is required and break it down into smaller peices. After this I create a flowchart that will map the processes i think the computer will go through. The next step is translating this to a programming language.

### 2. Interpreter: An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

### 4. Procedural: Procedral programming relies on procedures. A procedure contains a series of computational steps to be carried out.

### 5. Event driven: 'Event driven' is a programming paradigm where control flow is determined by the occurrence of events.

### 6. Oject oriented: In programmming 'object orientated' means that it works using objects,as opposed to actions and data rather than logic.

### 7. Compiler: Compiler describes computer software that is used to translate code from one language to another.
