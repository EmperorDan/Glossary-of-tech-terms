# ERD

## Entity Relationship Diagram
#### What it is
ER-modeling is a data modeling technique used in software engineering to produce a conceptual data model of a information system. Diagrams created using this ER-modeling technique are called Entity-Relationship Diagrams, or ER diagrams or ERDs. So you can say that Entity Relationship Diagrams illustrate the logical structure of databases.

#### Student, module, course, department scenario.
 
“A student registers for up to 8 modules and each module has many
students on it. Record the student ID, their full name and address and also
each module ID and title. Also, each module is related to a specific course,
each course has a course ID and a title. Also, each course is related to a
department. Finally, each department has a department ID, a name, and a
head of the department” 

Below is an example of an ERD. This is drawn from the above scenario:
