# SCRUM

intro:
Scrum is a framework to support teams in complex product development. Scrum consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Below are ten commonly used terms used within a scrum.

1 Daily Scrum: 
Daily time-boxed event of 15 minutes, or less, for the Development Team to re-plan the next day of development work during a Sprint. Updates are reflected in the Sprint Backlog.

2 Definition of Done: 
A shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the Development Team.

3 Emergence:
The process of the coming into existence or prominence of new facts or new knowledge of a fact, or knowledge of a fact becoming visible unexpectedly.

4 Increment:
A piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments -as a whole - form a product.

5 Product Backlog:
An ordered list of the work to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Managed by the Product Owner.

6 Refinement:
Refinement is the process through which items are reviewed by the Scrum team and revised, providing more detail and ensuring that there is greater clarity in the requirements for that item.

7 Scrum Master:
The role within a Scrum Team accountable for guiding, coaching, teaching and assisting a Scrum Team and its environments in a proper understanding and use of Scrum.

8 Sprint:
Time-boxed event of 30 days, or less, that serves as a container for the other Scrum events and activities. Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps.

9 Stakeholder:
A person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Represented by the Product Owner and actively engaged with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.

10 Values: 
When the values of Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness and Respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and builds trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts.
