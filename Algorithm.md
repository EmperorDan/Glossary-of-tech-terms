## Process in building application
### Who are your audience?
This is the most important decision to make as it effects the entire application. Changing mid way can be detrimental to your projects life.
### High level user stories
These are the things that the user is going to want to do with your application. This step also helps solidifiy your idea, as you find yourself second guessing previous decisions. 
### Storyboards & Wireframes
Draw mock-ups of what your application is going to look like. Include your user interface and show how pages links to one another. This will give you an idea of what you'll need to do.
### Design
After completing your wireframes, create high quality images from them. These images are what your app will look like. You need to decide on the aesthetic of your application. The things to consider being fonts, colours, logos, ect. Its important to understand what your application is going to be. And the design stage grants a clearer view of what your creating. 
### Development
Management tools are used during this stage. There are dozens, but a popular methodology is SCRUM. This stage is important, as it can be easy to lose money to mistakes. Communication is incredibly important when creating an application. With everyone working on different parts, without communication their is more room for human error. 
### Beta Testing
When you have a near-finished version of your product, you want to beta test it. The benefit is the information you gather from the people. This stage will tell you what you need to improve to get better feedback. You may also encounter bugs, and/or glitches that you will then have the opportunity to rectify.  
### Release
You have created your application and must release it. You must still advertise your product, and improve its performance.
