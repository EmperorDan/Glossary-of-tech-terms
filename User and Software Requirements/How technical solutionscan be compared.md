# Explain User and Software Requirements


The software requirements are what is given to you by the client. When you first meet them they will do a presentation or give you information on what they want in the product. They will give you a brief of the project it will be your job to break it down and create Epic Stories which you will use as your mile stones when designing and programming it you will have to implement these stories. You will also break down User Stories which can be used to make smaller stories to follow while you work and also they can help for debugging. There are also many other software requirements which need to be addressed such as Purpose, System Overview,

Epic Stories is a large body of work that are normally addressed as milestones for most programmers. Which they may meet over time by completing smaller tasks.

User Stories are a smaller amount of work than an Epic Story these User Stories can also be known as tasks which can be completed within a day or two. There is normally a certain number of User Stories in side of an Epic Story

Purpose, the purpose of the project is always at the top of the document and will be a description of the whole project and what the outcome should be this is before it is broken down into stories.

Overview is down when a mile stone is complete or when the project is complete and you are doing final checks and debugging.
